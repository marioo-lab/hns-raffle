# Handshake Raffle

A blockchain-based raffle system for Handshake domains with automatic winner selection.

## How It Works

**Entry**: Send HNS to the raffle address during the active period
**Duration**: 7 days (1,008 blocks)
**Winner Selection**: Automatic using block height for randomness
**Cost**: 1 HNS = 1 entry (send more HNS for more chances)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Prize Verification

- ‚úÖ **Verified**: Safe to participate - operator owns the domain
- ‚ùå **Unverified**: Transfer may be pending - operator doesn't own the domain yet

## How to Enter

1. **Check Verification**: Look for ‚úÖ next to the prize
2. **Wait for Active Period**: Only entries during active period count
3. **Send HNS**: Send to the raffle address using any Handshake wallet
4. **Wait**: Your entry shows as ‚è≥ pending, then ‚úÖ confirmed
